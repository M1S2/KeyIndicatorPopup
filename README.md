# KeyIndicatorPopup

Version: v1.0.0

## Purpose
This application can be used to display any pressed keys. Whenever a key is pressed, a popup window appears showing which key was pressed.

The keys are grouped into one of the following groups:
- Lock keys (NUM-, CAPS- or ROLL-Lock keys)
- Letter keys (letters A - Z)
- Numeric keys (numeric keys 0 - 9. Also containing 0 - 9 on the numpad)
- System keys (all other keys)

This application was developed for all keyboards which drivers didn't show the lock key status out of the box.
